# Feature Specification: Flatmate Life Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-flatmate-life`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The Flatmate Life Tracker is an all-in-one app designed to make shared living easier, fairer, and more organized. It allows flatmates to track expenses by splitting both household bills and casual non-household costs like drinks or takeout, while a balance dashboard keeps everyone clear on who owes what. A shared groceries tracker helps avoid double-buying and ensures everyone's contributions are visible, making food shopping much simpler. The app also includes a cleaning tracker with rotating chores and reminders, so the workload is shared fairly and nothing is forgotten. To support health and accountability, there's a gym tracker where flatmates can log sessions, track progress, and even set collective fitness goals together. Beyond this, the app provides shared notes for things like shopping lists, reminders for important events such as bill due dates, and a lightweight chat board for house communication. Altogether, it creates a fair, transparent, and supportive system for managing both the practical and social sides of living with a flatmate.. Also do not implement user auth for now but can be added later"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements

   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A group of flatmates living together needs a centralized system to manage their shared household responsibilities and expenses. They want to track who paid for what, ensure chores are distributed fairly, coordinate grocery shopping without duplication, support each other's fitness goals, and communicate about household matters‚Äîall in one place. The app should provide transparency and fairness, reducing conflicts over money and chores while fostering a cooperative living environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** two flatmates share an apartment, **When** one flatmate pays a $120 electricity bill and splits it equally, **Then** the system shows each flatmate owes $60, and the balance dashboard reflects one flatmate owes the other $60.

2. **Given** flatmates have a rotating cleaning schedule, **When** a new week begins, **Then** the system automatically assigns the next person in rotation to each chore and sends reminders.

3. **Given** a flatmate purchases milk and bread at the grocery store, **When** they log these items with the cost, **Then** other flatmates can see what's been bought and the contribution is tracked against that person's account.

4. **Given** flatmates want to collectively go to the gym 20 times this month, **When** each flatmate logs their gym sessions, **Then** the system shows progress toward the collective goal and individual contributions.

5. **Given** a flatmate needs to remember when the internet bill is due, **When** they create a reminder for the bill due date, **Then** all flatmates receive a notification [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how many days before the due date? Same day? Customizable?]

6. **Given** flatmates are communicating about a house party, **When** they post messages on the chat board, **Then** all flatmates can see the conversation in chronological order.

7. **Given** a flatmate goes out for takeout and another flatmate wants to contribute, **When** they split the $45 cost unevenly (e.g., $30/$15), **Then** the balance dashboard updates to reflect the split amounts owed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a flatmate marks a chore as complete but another disputes it? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: dispute resolution mechanism needed?]
- How does the system handle when someone moves out mid-month with outstanding balances? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: settlement process not specified]
- What happens if two flatmates simultaneously add the same grocery item? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: duplicate detection or merging logic?]
- How are expenses handled when splitting isn't equal (e.g., 3-way split where one person pays nothing)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: flexible split percentages or fixed amounts?]
- What happens when a flatmate deletes an expense that others have already acknowledged? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: deletion permissions and impact on balances]
- How far back can users view historical data (old expenses, completed chores, past gym sessions)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention/archival policy not specified]
- What happens if someone logs a gym session for a past date? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: are backdated entries allowed?]
- How are reminders dismissed or marked as complete?
- Can flatmates edit or delete each other's entries (expenses, chores, groceries)?
